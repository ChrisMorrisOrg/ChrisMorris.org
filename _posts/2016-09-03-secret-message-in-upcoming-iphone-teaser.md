We're only a few days away from Apple's [upcoming September event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/) where the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be announced. I couldn't help but notice the teaser image on Apple's website happens to align extremely well with the leaked photos of the alleged iPhone 7 Plus. Although it has long been rumoured that the iPhone 7 Plus would feature a dual-lens setup, Apple's marketing team might have just confirmed those leaks. Surely this isn't a coincidence. I've made a video below to demonstrate what I'm referring to, against a shoddy image of a fake iPhone 7 Plus. Take a look for yourself, what do you think?

The teaser image appears to show an Apple logo, perhaps made up from various light sources at different distances. Some circles are in focus, while others are more blurry. This leads me to speculate if the new iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens camera system will allow users to adjust the focus of their photos after they have taken them. After all, Apple did [purchase LinX](http://lightfield-forum.com/2015/04/apple-buys-array-camera-maker-linx-for-dslr-quality-and-light-field-imaging/) last year.
