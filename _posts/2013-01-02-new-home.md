It's 2013 and I've made the final move to my new domain name [ChrisMorris.org](https://chrismorris.org). For all of 2012 I was located at [ChrisMorris.co](https://chrismorris.co), but people often confused the .co extension for .com and tried emailing me at chrismorris.com - a domain I do not own.

Over the next several weeks I'll restore old posts to this new website, and I'll also be tweaking the design. In the meantime, please continue to visit [the old site](https://chrismorris.co) until I've completely moved :).
