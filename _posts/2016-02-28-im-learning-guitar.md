## Inspiration

I'm a **huge** fan of Linkin Park, I've been listening to their music since all the way back in primary school! Hands down, my favourite song of theirs is [By Myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWBp-nlGX1o), from Hybrid Theory. It's an artistic masterpiece and, I think, one of their most underrated songs.

The synth in the background gives such a feeling of isolation, and the lyrics are intense - "If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer, then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer". My favourite part of the song is probably where Chester [raises his vocals](https://youtu.be/wWBp-nlGX1o?t=149) the third time around when he sings "I can't hold on", it screams of desperation. It's attention to detail like this that makes me love Linkin Park so much! They don't just design catchy beats and heavy riffs, they tell a story.

So, with this song as one of the main inspirations for me to learn how to play guitar, I decided to purchase a sleek, [black Yamaha Gigmaker FX](http://www.cranbournemusic.com.au/cstore/930042018266.html)! Hopefully I can learn to play along with [the instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA4UjKYRvT4) in time.

## Yamaha Gigmaker FX

Since I purchased the guitar [as a pack](http://www.cranbournemusic.com.au/cstore/930042018266.html), I also received the VOX Mini3 amplifier. This thing sounds so great! Like any amplifier, I can get a really heavy sound, or a really clean sound by messing around with the gain and volume. Originally, I was going to purchase a cheaper guitar pack which contained an Essex AGA1065 amp, but the sound quality the Mini3 provides is so much better for what I want - distortion!

## A New Journey

So, I'm finally learning guitar! Once I can actually play something decent, maybe I'll upload a track here. For now, the list of songs I want to learn how to play on guitar includes:

- Linkin Park - "A Place For My Head"
- Linkin Park - "By Myself"
- Linkin Park - "Faint"
- Linkin Park - "One Step Closer"
- Three Days Grace - "Animal I Have Become"
- Three Days Grace - "The Good Life"
- Three Days Grace - "Riot"

In the meantime, I'm watching some awesome free online video tutorials from [Guitar Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bULnYSWNPE). So far I've learnt four main chords - Amin7, Cmaj, Dmaj, and Gmaj. Now I need to practice actually transitioning between the chords. It's super fun!
