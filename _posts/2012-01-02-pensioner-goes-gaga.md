What better way to end the year than to spend the final minutes of 2011 at [The Tivoli's](http://www.tivolitheatre.com.au/) final ever show? That's exactly what our family did, and I managed to record (in high definition) some of the craziest footage you've ever seen! You may know Terry Gill from the classic Australian film "Crackers," or perhaps from "Carols by Candlelight," where he plays Santa Claus every year. Terry is married to Carole Ann, together they ran The Tivoli which had it's final show on New Year's Eve. Essentially the owners of the building wanted them out unless they paid excessive prices to stay, and so they're having to close down... at least for now, perhaps in the future they will open a new place.

[The Tivoli](http://www.tivolitheatre.com.au/) put on shows focused on music from the 50's and 60's. Personally I can't relate to the music the same way that others in the audience could, yet, *even I* love the show. It was extremely entertaining... especially watching the "old farts," singing Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance." I hope Terry and Carole manage to find a new place or somehow work out a deal to stay where they are.
