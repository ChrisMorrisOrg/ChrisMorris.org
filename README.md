Overview
--------
This is the source code for my personal website [ChrisMorris.org](http://chrismorris.org). Feel free to browse and fork. If you have any questions, plase [contact me](http://chrismorris.org/contact).

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator. Jekyll converts all posts and pages from Markdown into static HTML files. Compared to WordPress, this allows the site to load extremely fast and vastly reduces resources required to run the website.

Because the pages are static, I use JavaScript to include view counts. View counts are recorded and accessed from a MySQL database via a simple Node.js script I wrote.

Design
------
As of January 3rd, 2013: The design is currently incomplete, and there will be many updates in the near future.

At present I would appreciate it if you create your own design should you fork this repository, simply because I am branding my work with the current design. Thank you!

Deploying
---------
Instructions and resources coming soon.
