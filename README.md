Overview
--------
This is the source code for my personal website [ChrisMorris.org](http://chrismorris.org). Feel free to browse and fork. If you have any questions, plase [contact me](http://chrismorris.org/contact).

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator. Jekyll converts all posts and pages from Markdown into static HTML files. Compared to WordPress, this allows the site to load extremely fast and vastly reduces resources required to run the website.

Because the pages are static, I use JavaScript to include view counts. View counts are recorded and accessed from a MySQL database via a simple Node.js script I wrote.

Design
------
As of January 3rd, 2013: The design is currently incomplete, and there will be many updates in the near future.

At present I would appreciate it if you create your own design should you fork this repository, simply because I am branding my work with the current design. Thank you!

There are several differnt colour schemes with the current design. Any post can be assigned a theme by adding "colour: <colour>", the default is blue.

Deploying
---------
Instructions and resources coming soon.

Background
----------
Jekyll was suggested to me by [Feross Aboukhadijeh](http://feross.org/). After seeing how fast his site loaded, I was sold.

The inspiration for the design was sporadic. I wanted an organised layout, but I also wanted to take advantage of CSS3 and give the site a bit of a futuristic feeling. I was aiming for a design that felt a bit like a computer display that you might see on a spaceship.
