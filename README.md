Overview
--------
This is the source code for my personal website [ChrisMorris.org](https://chrismorris.org). Feel free to browse and fork. If you have any questions, please [contact me](https://twitter.com/ChrisMorrisOrg).

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator. Jekyll converts all posts and pages from Markdown into static HTML files. Compared to WordPress, this allows the site to load extremely fast and vastly reduces resources required to run the website.

Because the pages are static, I use JavaScript to include view counts and Disqus for the commenting system. View counts are recorded and accessed from a MySQL database via a simple Node.js script.

Design
------
At present I would appreciate it if you create your own design should you fork this repository, simply because I am branding my work with the current and previous design. Thank you!

Deployment
----------
The website runs on an Nginx server, with supervisord running the Node application in the background. MySQL is also required for the view counter.

Have a read through the package.json file to see how you can run `npm run push` to do your blog writing on your local computer and have it rsync'd to your server.

For information on how to setup these services, I recommend checking out these articles:

Background
----------
Jekyll was suggested to me by [Feross Aboukhadijeh](http://feross.org/). After seeing how fast his site loaded, I was sold. A lot of functionality of this website has been taken or inspired from [feross.org](https://github.com/feross/feross.org)
