5nake is an HTML5 remake of the classic Nokia game, Snake. The project was started merely to learn more about HTML5 and canvas. Since it's initial launch, the official website [5nake.com](http://5nake.com) has had hundreds of games played and dozens of likes on Facebook - pretty cool for such an old game!

The source code for 5nake is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/5nake). Feel free to fork and contribute to the project.

You can also find a list of [known bugs](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/5nake/wiki/Known-Bugs) and a complete breakdown of the [version history](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/5nake/wiki/Version-History) on the [5nake GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/5nake/wiki).
