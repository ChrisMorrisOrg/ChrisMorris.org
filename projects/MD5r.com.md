MD5r is a simple PHP-MySQL application that allows you to hash strings using the MD5 message digest algorithm. These messages are then stored with their associated digest in a MySQL database (which acts as a rainbow table), allowing you to revert hashes back into their original form should the database store the relationship.

MD5r comes with the default UNIX dictionary and a simple hash generator to get your rainbow table started.

More information will be added to this page soon, in the meantime you can see MD5r in action at [MD5r.com](https://md5r.com), or check out the source at [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/MD5r.com).
