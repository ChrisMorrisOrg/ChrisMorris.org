Py-in-Pi is a Python application intended to be run within Terminal. It's easy to setup and use, and gives some amazing visuals of how Pi is calculated using various different methods.

More information will be added to this page soon, in the meantime you can download the Python script from [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/Pi-in-Py).
