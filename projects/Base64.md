Base64 is a simple JavaScript app I hacked together for base64 URL generation. Although originally intended for image URL generation, it can generate base64 for other file types too, including PDF and MP3.

You can try the app out at [base64.ChrisMorris.org](http://base64.chrismorris.org), where you will see your chosen image instantly set to the background of the page - no uploading required, purely JavaScript and CSS... and, of course, base64 data URL encoding.

Check out the source at [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisMorrisOrg/Base64).
